Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to allow for two players on different machines to be able to play a game of tictactoe. Players will alternate turns until the game finishes. This game is a proof-of-concept of C4C’s multiplayer game infrastructure, which will allow future games to be played between multiple players simultaneously. 


Documentation:
/{gameid} GET: send a gameid to getGameState, which returns the current state of the game at that gameid after the other player moves.
/{gameid} POST: send a gameid to getItemUpdated, which updates the game state, and returns whether it worked or not.


Notes:
We have:
2 players
Different computers
One’s player 1 with X’s
The other is player 2 with O’s
Problem:
We need player 2 to know when and where player 1 puts an X
And vice versa
Actions:
Player 1 can place an X
Player 2 can place a O
Solution:
Server
What’s a server:
Just another computer
But it listens for requests from other computers
What can it do:
Receive and store information
Give information out
Uses here:
Send the server placement of an X or an O
Server needs to store the locations of the X’s and O’s
“game state”
Server needs to give out that information when asked
Functions of a server (backend):
Database
Stores data
Web API (Application Programming Interface)
Fancy piece of code
Listens for requests for information and pushes of info
Functions to link the two
Needed Actions:
Start a game
Join a game
Write to a square
Read from a square
